# Layers source code

## Compile and install

> 
> you need to have **g++** and **make** installed, and the **Flex** library to link the parser (-lfl). In case you want to modify the parser (but this is no requiered for normal installation) you would need Bison  as well.
>

### **Since version V.04 the compilation is just straightforward:**

~~~shell
cd src
make clean
make
~~~

DONE!

*This will be enabled soon.*
*For GPU usage please first check [GPU set up guide](https://github.com/RParedesPalacios/Layers/blob/master/src/gpu_install.md*
*cd src;*
*make CORE=0;*
*make CORE=1;*
*option 0 compiles Layers only for CPU. option 1 compiles both for GPU and CPU. You then select what to use from the parser.*

### Compiling on MAC:


* Use the MAC Flags that appear in the Makefile

* You need some alternative to:
 
 clock_gettime and CLOCK_MONOTONIC
 
* See this stackoverflow [post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5167269/clock-gettime-alternative-in-mac-os-x) or just **comment the following line in the net.cpp**

~~~c
#define USETIME 
~~~

* In case you use a gcc compiler from Homebrew, unlink it and use the default gcc installed:

~~~c
brew unlink gcc
~~~

### Compiling on Windows:

* Try and push it! ...  ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
