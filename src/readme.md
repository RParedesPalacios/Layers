# Layers source code

## Compile and install

> 
> you need to have **g++** and **make** installed. For the parser you need Flex library to link (-lfl)
>

### **Since version V.04 the compilation is just straightforward:**

~~~shell
cd src
make clean
make
~~~


DONE!

### Compiling on MAC:

* You need some alternative to:
 
 clock_gettime and CLOCK_MONOTONIC
 
* See this stackoverflow [post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5167269/clock-gettime-alternative-in-mac-os-x) or just comment the following line in the net.cpp:

~~~c
#define USETIME 
~~~

* Use the MAC Flags that appear in the Makefile


### Compiling on Windows:

* Try and push it! ...  ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
