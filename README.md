* A Neural Network toolkit.


* Layers is written in C++. 


* Layers uses [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page), [OpenMP](http://openmp.org/wp/) and ad-hoc [multi-threading](https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/pthreads/)

* Some features:
	* Flexible.
	* Easy to use. 
	* Layers provides a prototype and script language in order to ease the networks definition and experimentation. 
	* Optimized for CPU (not GPU).
	* Mainly for academic use. Layers is used in the following subjects:
		* Neural Networks
		* Computer Vision

## Usage

Layers only requires one argument, a net file:

> **layers file.net**

see some examples of net files in the [examples](https://github.com/RParedesPalacios/Layers/tree/master/examples) section
